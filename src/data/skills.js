                desc: 'During my studies at FTN and through courses at Campster and SmartInIt, I became proficient with the essential tools for creating websites. I started with HTML (HTML5) to build the skeleton of web pages, incorporating semantic HTML to add more meaningful structure. My first experience with styling was with CSS (CSS3), and to improve styling organization, I practiced using the Sass preprocessor, which compiles into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).\nI then learned to add logic to web pages through JavaScript. My journey with JavaScript included understanding fundamental concepts such as data types, loops, functions, and hoisting, as well as DOM manipulation using various methods to select HTML nodes and elements. I strengthened my frontend knowledge further during the Campster and SmartInIt courses.'

                desc: 'Through the SmartInIt course, I learned how to prepare my code for app creation using Angular, a JavaScript framework designed with a component-based architecture. This approach helped me break down complex logic into smaller, reusable parts, making my code more efficient. The course also covered services, pipes, observables, animations, and routing for single-page applications (SPA). Although JavaScript can be the base for Angular, we used TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that includes type definitions and other features, making it easier to write and maintain large applications. Additionally, we were introduced to Redux for state management.'

I learned key concepts such as creating components, understanding relationships between elements (parent, child, siblings), and managing data flow using props and state. I also studied the component lifecycle, including initial mounting and re-rendering with the useEffect hookâ€™s dependency array, and using hooks to manage state and side effects efficiently.'

During my time at SmartInIt, I learned to use JSON Server as a mocking server and Angular In-memory Web API as a CRUD API emulator. Node.js and its framework, Express, served as my server platform, providing localhost access. To create single-page applications (SPAs), we implemented routes that dynamically changed page content based on the current route, introducing me to RESTful APIs for performing CRUD operations on endpoints.'

MongoDB provided insights into the differences between relational (e.g., MySQL) and NoSQL databases. The core distinction lies in schema handling: relational databases use predefined table schemas applied uniformly to records, while NoSQL databases, represented in JSON format, offer greater flexibility with schema-less documents. Mongoose library usage with MongoDB allowed me to explore schema validation, aligning my preference towards NoSQL data handling.'
